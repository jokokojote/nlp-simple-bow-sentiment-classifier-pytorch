# Simple BOW Classifier
This code trains a simple Bag-of-Words model for sentiment classification of reviews with PyTorch. 

I used the Yelp Review Polarity Dataset available at Xiang Zhang's Google Drive dir [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz8a_Dbh9Qhbfll6bVpmNUtUcFdjYmF2SEpmZUZUcVNiMUw1TWN6RDV3a0JHT3kxLVhVR2M?resourcekey=0-TLwzfR2O-D2aPitmn5o9VQ) and used in

Pretty surprising, that it is possible to achive 80%+ accuracy on this task with such a simple model and without any text preprocessing.
